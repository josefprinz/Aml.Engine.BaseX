## Aml.Engine.BaseX


This repository contains the source code for an extension package of the **[AutomationML Engine](https://github.com/AutomationML/AMLEngine2.1)** by a service to store and process AutomationML documents in a **[BaseX](https://basex.org/)** database. The AutomationML Engine is provided by [AutomationML](https://www.automationml.org) for processing AutomationML documents. AutomationML is a standardized data exchange format, developed to support the data exchange in automation systems engineering.  

The AutomationML BaseX engine is developed to provide a Plugin for the **[AutomationML Editor](https://github.com/AutomationML/AutomationMLEditor)** which can be used to visualize and edit AutomationML model data, stored in a BaseX database. Those interested in the development of this plugin can follow the development progress on [Josef Prinz's blog](https://josefprinz.github.io/automationml/2022/12/29/Setting-up-the-development-environment-for-AMLBaseX/). The plugin source code is provided [here](https://github.com/josefprinz/Aml.Editor.Plugin.BaseX).
